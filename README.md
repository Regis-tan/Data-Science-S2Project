# **Data Science session 2 project** <br/>
## **Description** <br/>
### This is my data science project for data science class, it is a web scraper that takes data using the Bs4 Python library and converts it into a CSV file format. <br/>
## **Content** <br/>
### [Parser 1](parser-1.py)
  -[Data for parser 1](data-1.csv)
### [Parser 2](parser-2.py)
  -[Data for parser 2](data-2.csv)
## **Notes** <br/>
### There are 2 .py files, data-1 is the output of parser-1 and data-2 is the output of parser-2. I made 2 parsers because parser-1 uses data from the website that doesn't allow it according to their TOU which I was not aware of. But, I think it should be fine as the data is not used for anything and only 1 page was parsed.
