**#Data Science session 2 project** <br/>
__ <br/>
**D##escription** <br/>
###This is my data science project for data science class, it is a web scraper that takes data using the Bs4 Python library and converts it into a CSV file format. <br/>
__ <br/>
**##Notes** <br/>
###There are 2 .py files, data-1 is the output of parser-1 and data-2 is the output of parser-2. I made 2 parsers because parser-1 uses data from the website that doesn't allow it according to their TOU which I was not aware of.
